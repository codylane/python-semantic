# python-semantic
A python semantic version library for comparing software versions

Info
====
I wrote this code some time last year and I didn't have time to write
tests.  I'm very sorry for that but I will at some point.  I believe I
tested this code with some basic test scripts.  If you find a bug please submit
a pull request and I will take prompt action to fix it.

Let's make this better together.

I hope you find this useful.  The code should contain pydoc information
on how to use it.
